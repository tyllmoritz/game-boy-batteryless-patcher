; CARTRIDGE TYPE AND ROM SIZE
; ---------------------------
; Usually, it's safe to keep the same original game's ROM type and size, since
; RGBDS will automatically fix the ROM's header if we expand it for the
; savegame.
; Uncomment the following constants if you want to manually specify cartridge
; type and/or size:
; DEF CHANGE_CART_TYPE EQU CART_ROM_MBC5_RAM_BAT
; DEF CHANGE_CART_SIZE EQU CART_ROM_2048KB ;128 banks



; SRAM ORIGINAL SIZE
; ------------------
; Set to 1 if game's original SRAM is 32kb
DEF SRAM_SIZE_32KB EQU 0



; GAME BOOT OFFSET
; ----------------
; Put here the game's boot jp offset found in in 0:0101.
; Usually $0150, but could be different depending on game.
DEF GAME_BOOT_OFFSET EQU $0150



; BANK 0 ROM FREE SPACE
; ---------------------
; We need ~60 bytes (~0x3c bytes) in bank 0 for our new subroutines:
; - new boot: will read savegame from Flash ROM and write to SRAM during boot
; - new save/erase: will copy SRAM to Flash ROM when saving game
; - copying helper subroutine
; Hopefully, there should be enough space at the end of bank 0.
; If there is not enough space there, check $0070-$0100, some games didn't
; store anything there.
; In the worst scenario, you will need to carefully move some code/data to
; other banks.
DEF BANK0_FREE_SPACE EQU $3fc0



; RAM FREE SPACE
; --------------
; Bootleg's Flash ROM reading is locked when trying to write to it, so we need
; to store and run our new subroutines in WRAM0 instead of ROM.
; We need ~80 bytes (~0x50 bytes).
; Check which WRAM0 sections are safe to write with a debugger.
; If the game uses some compression or temporary section to store data, that
; should be safe to use.
; In the worst scenario, use shadow OAM space. It will just glitch sprites for
; a single frame.
DEF WRAM_FREE_SPACE EQU $cf40



; NEW CODE LOCATION
; -----------------
; We need ~80 bytes (~0x50 bytes) to store our new battery-less save code.
; As stated above, they will be copied from ROM to WRAM0 when trying to save.
DEF BATTERYLESS_CODE_BANK EQU $7e
DEF BATTERYLESS_CODE_OFFSET EQU $4000



; GAME ENGINE'S CURRENT BANK BACKUP LOCATION
; ------------------------------------------
; Games usually store the current ROM bank number in RAM or HRAM, so they can
; restore the correct bank when switching back from VBlank.
; We will reuse that byte when switching to our battery-less code bank and,
; afterwards, so we can restore to the previous bank.
DEF GAME_ENGINE_CURRENT_BANK_OFFSET EQU $fff8



; SAVEGAME LOCATION IN FLASH ROM
; ------------------------------
; Starting Flash ROM bank where savegame data will be saved.
; IMPORTANT: It must be an entire 64kb flashable block!
; If the game has not a free 64kb block, just use a bank bigger than the
; original ROM and RGBDS will expand the ROM and fix the header automatically.
DEF BANK_FLASH_DATA EQU $80



; EMBED CUSTOM SAVEGAME
; ---------------------
; Set to 1 if you want to embed your own savegame to the Flash ROM.
; Place the savegame file as embed_savegame.sav in src directory.
DEF EMBED_SAVEGAME EQU 0



; ORIGINAL SAVE SUBROUTINE
; ------------------------
; We need to find the original game's saving subroutine and hook our new code
; afterwards.
SECTION "Original save SRAM subroutine end", ROM0[$0a9e]
;call	$0a46
call	save_sram_hook
ret

SECTION "Save SRAM hook", ROM0[$3fb8]
save_sram_hook:
	;original code
	call	$0a46
	
	;new code
	call	save_sram_to_flash
	ret
