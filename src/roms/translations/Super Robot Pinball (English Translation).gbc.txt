Super Robot Pinball english translation
=======================================

Super Robot Pinball is a pinball game made by Jupiter, the same team behind Pokémon Pinball series.
Indeed, it plays similar to the first Pokémon Pinball (GBC), it even uses the same engine but with greatly improved physics. However, instead of catching monsters, you fight robots from Super Robot Wars series, that includes Gundam, Evangelion, Mazinger Z and many more!
You choose a Super Robot hero and fight evil enemy robots in intense pinball fights! Every Super Robot has its own stats and special ability, so there is room for little strategy. Once you defeat an enemy, it gets added to the Super Robot library. Good luck completing it, more than 40 heroes and 60 enemies await!


Translation status
------------------
The game is fully playable, though a couple of things remain untranslated:
* Super Robot descriptions & attack names
These would take ages to translate, but fortunately they have no impact on playability.
Instead of leaving the descriptions as unreadable, they have been replaced by other data like Super Robot series origin and first appearance date.
